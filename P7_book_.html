        <h2>About the Book</h2>
        <p>Stephen Hawking was considered one of the most brilliant theoretical physicists in history. From the Big Bang to black holes, his work on the universeâ€™s origins and structure revolutionized the field. Hawking was born in Oxford into a family of doctors. He began his university education at University College, Oxford, in 1959. He received a first-class BA degree in physics. Hawking began his graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in 1962. He obtained his Ph.D. degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, specializing in general relativity and cosmology, in March 1966. Like Isaac Newton, he was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge between 1979 and 2009. At age 21, while studying cosmology at the University of Cambridge, he was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Part of his life story was depicted in the 2014 film The Theory of Everything.</p>
